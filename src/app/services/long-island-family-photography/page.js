   <div className="text3">When was the last time you had a professionally taken family photo? If you can’t remember, or if it’s been a few years, now is a great time have one done. Whether it’s for a holiday card, to celebrate Easter, or simply because you haven’t taken one to show off how everyone in the family has changed, now is a good of a time as there’s ever been.
<br />There’s no limit to what we can do with family photography. If you haven’t yet, check out my portfolio to see some of my favorites from the past. Of course, I’d love to hear your own ideas for a family photography session. Every family is unique, and I want to capture this uniqueness within your own photos.
<br />I typically service individuals from Long Island, Nassau County and Suffolk County region (although I’d love to have you come into the studio wherever you’re from). If you are not interested in studio work we can also visit one of our partner outdoor venues (parks mostly) to set up the right photo shoot for your unique needs.
<br />Feel free to use the booking option built into the website, or you can email me, call me, or contact with through social media with any other questions you might have about my family (or other) photography services.
