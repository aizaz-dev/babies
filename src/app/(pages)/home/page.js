            My Long Island newborn photography studio allows you and your
            newborn to feel comfortable, at peace, relaxed and ready to capture
            these precious few weeks of your newborn’s life. My goal with every
            newborn photo shoot is to capture your child’s genuine personality
            perfectly and naturally through the eyes of a trained Long Island
            newborn photographer. What sets my photography studio apart from the
            rest, is the experience I provide to the parents and the newborn.

            are in the right, caring, and gentle hands of someone who truly
            loves to photograph and capture these wonderful memories. This is
            because photography is not about simply creating memories by
            snapping photos it is about transforming memories into reality using
            the skills I’ve picked up over the many years of photographing
            newborns like yours.

            What is the ideal age for a newborn photography photo shoot
          </p>
          <p className="mess1">
            Many people believe you must photograph a newborn in the first 14
            days of their life. While this may be true for some photographers, I
            specialize in photographing newborns of Ages up to 8 weeks old. I do
            this to provide the flexibility and express my understanding for
            what happens in the first few weeks of life with you and your
            newborn. Not every parent is going to be ready to photograph their
            newborn within the first 14 days of the baby’s life, for many
            reasons this is something that I take very seriously. I have served
            Long Island families with newborns ranging from 7 days to 8 weeks of
            age. You will be pleasantly surprised how wonderfully you can
            capture these precious moments, even when your child is nearly 2
            months of age.

            Sessions can last anywhere from 1 hour to about 3 hours, depending
            on the package you select. In our Long Island newborn photography
            studio, we have setups for both sibling, and parent photos during
            your newborn photo shoot. Our basic packages includes just the
            newborn photos, while our Premier packages allow you to capture both
            sibling pictures, and parent photos as well. Depending on the
            package you choose you will receive more prop setups, more outfits,
            and generally speaking a longer photo session with more edited
            images.

            gear, firefighters gear, and so much more. So feel free to bring
            anything you like to the session, just let me know ahead of time so

            long they have been doing this work and how many babies they have
            handled and photographed in their career. I have been professionally
            trained by the world’s best newborn photographers for more than a
            decade on how to handle and safely capture your baby’s first few
            weeks of life. My editing style is also natural and beautiful so
            that the work you receive will truly represent the beauty and
            innocence of your newborn baby. this is done in both how I how I
            shoot the photos end how their professionally edited. If you are
            looking for a newborn photographer who has a decade and more than
            500 shoots under her belt, then I am the right choice as your Long

            sit back, and relax. This experience is meant to be memorable,
            enjoyable, and peaceful. You will be sent a list of props and
