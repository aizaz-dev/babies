        Every Long Island family has their favorite 
        beach spot where they go for relaxation and 
        recreation, and to spend valuable time together. 
        When the weather gets warm, families who live 
        in Nassau County and Suffolk County head for 
        the sea. What better way to celebrate and 
        commemorate these special moments you spend 
        together than with beach family portraits! No 
        matter how many family members, whether mom, 
        dad, and baby, or the entire extended family 
        clan, the beach makes the perfect windswept 
        backdrop for memorable, scenic beach family 
        portraits photo shoots that you will treasure 
        for a lifetime.

        My name is Claudette, and through my studio, 
        CLJ Photography, I have given hundreds of local 
        Long Island families the beach family portraits 
        they treasure. I specialize in shooting on 
        location, incorporating natural lighting and 
        the natural elements of the Long Island shore. 
        This is what enables me to achieve my signature 
        artistic style. Thanks to my many years of 
        experience, I am able to guide you, providing 
        beach family photos tips that will really make 
        your portraits pop. Beach family portraits photo 
        shoots have special considerations, such as sun, 
        wind, sand, and of course, water! I will help to 
        choose the ideal wardrobe with my many beach 
        family portraits clothing ideas, and make 
        suggestions for hair and makeup for the big day.

        The first step is to schedule a consultation with 
        me, your photographer, before the photoshoot. 
        Here, we will share your vision and ideas for 
        your beach family portraits, and I will guide 
        you through my beach family portraits tips to 
        arrive at the perfect plan. When you work with 
        me, I ensure every member of the family is happy 
        and comfortable throughout the photo shoot. 
        There are special considerations for newborns, 
        just as there are for octogenarians. Through my 
        exceptional care and compassion, I help families 
        make memories they will treasure forever during 
        their beach family portraits photo shoots in Long 
        Island, all while simultaneously capturing them 
        in my professional beach family photos.
