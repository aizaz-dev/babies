        There is nothing quite as beautiful as spring 
        in Long Island. As the world awakens from 
        another cold Suffolk County and Nassau County 
        winter season, it is the perfect time to 
        celebrate the warming weather and your 
        family’s togetherness with CLJ Photography 
        spring family photos shoots. Whether for 
        the Easter holiday, or simply to express 
        the love you share, it is never too soon to 
        book your upcoming spring family photo shoot!

        As a photographer, I specialize in capturing 
        stunning images with natural lighting. With all 
        of Nassau County and Suffolk County at your 
        doorstep, this is a wonderful chance to 
        incorporate special outdoor and on-site 
        locations into your spring family photo shoot. 
        Is there a particular place that is memorable 
        and magical to your family? Let’s bring it into 
        your family photo! If you are not sure where to 
        start, simply schedule a consultation. Over the 
        years, I have taken spring family photos shoots 
        all across Long Island, and am still full of 
        unique and creative spring family photo ideas. 
        Pose together with a sentimental treehouse, on 
        a favorite beach, or even in your own backyard.

        No family is too young or too old to commemorate 
        another spring with professional portraits. While 
        it is easier than ever to take and share a 
        photograph with technology and the internet, 
        my spring family photos shoots add the artistic 
        touch that is missing from point-and-shoot 
        photography. When we utilize my spring family 
        photoshoot ideas, these images become lasting 
        heirlooms. Your portraits can be given as gifts, 
        used on an Easter card, hung in your home or 
        office, or simply shared as a digital image.
