        With Easter around the corner, the weather in 
        Long Island begins to warm, flowers begin to 
        bloom, and those cold snow flurries turn into 
        the first spring showers. The Easter holiday 
        is an important time of year for many families 
        in Nassau County, Suffolk County, and Queens, 
        especially when your children are young. What 
        better way to celebrate this beautiful day, 
        than with charming and touching professional 
        Easter pictures?

        Easter photos are a wonderful opportunity to 
        capture your children with a collection of 
        festive props, adorable outfits, fresh flowers, 
        and even real live bunnies if you choose! From 
        dying eggs to opening Easter baskets, there are 
        so many Easter photo props and scenarios to 
        choose from. Do you already have inspiring 
        Easter photo ideas? Let me work to make your 
        vision a reality! If you would like assistance 
        setting the perfect scene, simply ask to see 
        my portfolio and hear my Easter photo ideas.

        Easter photos sessions are a great opportunity 
        to showcase my artistic style of outdoor 
        photography—my specialty—bathed in natural 
        lighting. Professional Easter pictures are 
        not only wonderful for your mantle or office, 
        they make fantastic Easter cards, and are the 
        perfect addition to any family’s collection of 
        photographic heirlooms. I have worked with 
        families of all sizes, and babies and children 
        of all ages, creating dreamy and magical images 
        that they and their own families treasure their 
        whole lives long. Let me capture the inner 
        spirit and unique personality of your family, 
        your child, and the holiday season.
