        The best, most unique and meaningful Christmas 
        cards and holiday season circulars feature 
        professional Christmas pictures of you and 
        your family. By incorporating personalized 
        Christmas photos with your holiday mailings, 
        you show just how much your family has grown 
        and changed within the past year, while also 
        capturing your shared holiday spirit in a 
        keepsake photo that will be treasured for 
        generations on the mantle, and in photo 
        albums. My artistic style incorporates 
        elements of your personal lifestyle and 
        your family’s personality into the photo, 
        making a beautiful statement about your 
        love and togetherness during the holiday 
        season. Choose to have your professional 
        Christmas pictures taken at home, at an 
        outdoor location of your choosing in Long 
        Island or Queens, or at my Nassau County 
        studio.

        Over the past few years, the popularity of 
        posting Christmas photo cards in the mail 
        has greatly increased. People are remembering 
        the joy and wonder felt during the holiday 
        season that both giving and receiving gifts 
        with personalized messages brings. Nothing 
        lets your loved ones know you are thinking 
        of them quite like a tailored message, 
        sending tidings of joy from your family 
        to theirs. By gracing your cards with 
        professional Christmas portraits this 
        year, you share more than just an image—you 
        share a snapshot of your lives representing 
        another great year in Nassau County or Suffolk 
        County, in communities like Massapequa, 
        New Hyde Park, Manhasset, and more.

        I would love to share all of my wonderful 
        ideas for original and creative Christmas 
        photos and professional Christmas portraits 
        with you and your loved ones! Many of my 
        clients come to me with a host of ideas for 
        the style and finish of professional Christmas 
        portraits they would like—I am here to capture 
        your ideal images! My specialty is capturing 
        images in natural lighting, especially images 
        on the beach, in the woods, on the dunes, 
        and around the quaint towns of Long Island. 
        Within each photo shoot I encourage memories 
        to unfold organically as you interact with 
        one another, snapshotting authentic moments 
        that are filled with genuine love and 
        affection. Whether in formal attire, 
        matching sweaters, Christmas morning pajamas, 
        or on a ski slope, no matter what your 
        personal holiday style and traditions, I 
        will ensure your Christmas photos capture 
        it perfectly.
